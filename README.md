# PushDown-Automata

A Pushdown Automaton (PDA) is a simple computing device capable of performing quite interesting and powerful computations (eg parsing programming languages). Computer Scientists design PDAs to recognize whether a token-stream is in some desired language (set of token-streams). 
In this project, we will implement a PDA processor in GoLang.
